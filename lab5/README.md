1. Create an Agent that accept only to ACLMessage types such as
ACLMessage.REQUEST and ACLMessage.CFP
if REQUEST it should print out the message
if CFP it should send back the message
2. Create an Agent that draws 1 or 2 than depends of the result it 
will send INFORM or CFP message and changes its behaviour to listen
for any incoming messages if the message will have specific value that kills the agent The Agent should be destoroyed
if message do not contains specific value it should switch back to his previous behaviour.
3. Create the Agent that listens for messages but prints out only those that have Polish language.
